 ------------------------------------------------------Problem statement----------------------------------------------------------------
 The application provides a health care and security solution for women. Our application will give a risk analysis of the most common health problems related to women. It provides the female user as a customer with a period tracker. It will enable the female user to complain about any type of violence or sexual harassment, if they consent to report the case then the medical results after the examination of the femaleâ€™s body will be directly sent to the police department for investigation and to the lawyer as well. This feature is developed because sometimes the violence starts at home and women do not feel safe to report that incident or sometimes, they are not comfortable sharing the details of that horrendous encounter with everyone all the time. They will get a list of NGOs nearby based on their pin code where they can go for help.. The reception will generate an appointment email to the user. Project aims to establish connection between different enterprises for a better flow of operation.

 AED Final Project (INFO 5100)

Project Deliverables: 
1) A running swing application that addresses the challenges outlined above 
at an eco-system scale. A typical implementation must include the 
participation of 4 enterprises, 8 organizations, and 10 roles. 
2) A presentation that outlines details specific to the design and 
implementation of your solution. This must include, the definition of the 
problem you solved, players and their contributions, use-cases, design, and 
implementation techniques followed. You must explain why each 
enterprise is essential to delivering the total value as outlined in your 
problem statement. 
3) A robust role-based authentication module with strong username and 
password capabilities. 
4) A reporting module with summarized view of the data in your system. This 
could include performance data that is important at the system or network 
level.
5) A configuration module with test cases that will populate your model and 
show the correctness of your solution. You might want to integration the 
Faker module from faker.com for random data generation.
